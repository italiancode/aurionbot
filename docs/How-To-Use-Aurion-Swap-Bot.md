### 2. `/import <privateKey>`

Import an existing Solana wallet using your private key.

**Example:**

```
/import 3dj6fS...yourBase58PrivateKeyHere...x93b
```

### 3. `/export`

Get your current wallet‚Äôs public and private keys stored by the bot.

### 4. `/swap <fromMint> <toMint> <amount>`

Swap tokens on the Solana blockchain.

- **fromMint** ‚Äî Token mint address you want to swap from.
- **toMint** ‚Äî Token mint address you want to swap to.
- **amount** ‚Äî Amount in lamports (smallest token unit).

**Example:**

```
/swap So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 USDCz1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234 1000000
